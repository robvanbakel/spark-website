# Spark Website

This landing page presents a brief summary of some of Spark's key features. The visitor can get a feel for what the app looks like and how it works, as well as visit the app's demo environment. Here, the user can interact with the app, add and edit employees and shifts, create new schedules and log in as an employee. Any changes made in the demo environment will only be reflected in the user's browser, resetting to its default state leaving the app.
